	<h1>Haymitch Abernathy</h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<pre>
Haymitch is the only current living victor from District 12. Being a past victor,
it is his job to prepare all of the new tributes from District 12. He is in charge
of all of the training, as well as controlling what gifts they are allowed to recieve
during the games. At first it looks like he shows favoritism to Peeta, but it is just
Katniss jumping to conclusions, as well as not getting along with him well.
