	<h1>Peeta Mellark</h1>
	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<pre>
Peeta never had a very difficult life, working in a bakery under his parents. The only thing we
really know about Peeta is that when Katniss was most in need, Peeta threw her two loaves of
burnt bread, which lead to him being beat by his mother.

	<h2>During the Games</h2>
	<pre>
We don't know much about Peeta's journey before meeting up with Katniss, just that he teamed up
with the career tributes to give himself a better shot at surviving the start of the games. Eventually
he escaped from them, and camoflaged himself by a river. Katniss found him nearly dead, but they
were able to work together and won the games together, the first time two tributes won.
