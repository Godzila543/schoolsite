	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<pre>
The Capitol is the central ruling body of Panem. All of the residents
live extremely easy lives because of the hard work of the districts they
rule over. There was once a war between The Capitol and the districts,
but The Capitol eventually won, and hold the Hunger Games every year both
as a means of entertainment for the residents, and as a way to remind the
districts that they have absolute power over them.
