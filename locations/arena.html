	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<pre>
Every year a new arena is constructed for the Hunger Games, and each is
full of unique environments. This year, the arena was mostly wooded area,
making it one of the easier environmets to survive in. However, water was
scarce, with one large lake, a few ponds, and a river. In past years, the
environment has been a freezing tundra, or a scorching dessert.
